# Predict Ads Click Through Rate With Microsoft Azure

Ads click through rate is a key metric of measuring the success of company's marketing initiatives. Since setting up these advertisement efforts are relatively costly, we would like to spend more efforts in campaigns that are successful. Having a model that can predict the click through rate of each advertisement could be tremendously helpful for business to make smart decisions. In this project, we will build a simple more that can predict the click through rate of all the ads with the help from Microsoft Azure. We will use Azure's hyperdrive to tune a customized lightGBM model, and compare the performance with the models that are generated by an automated machine learning process. The superior model will eventually be deployed to Azure Kubernetes Serivce and opreationalized. 

## Project Set Up and Installation

To set up the project in Azure, perform the following 3 simple steps

1. Access Azure Machine Learning Studio and create a notebook instance
2. Upload the following files to notebook instance - `automl.ipynb`, `hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb`, `fetch_dataset.sh`, `train.py` and `utils.py`
3. Run both `automl.ipynb` and `hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb`, relevant dataset and compute clusters will be set up automatically

## Dataset

### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
